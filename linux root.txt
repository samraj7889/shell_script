ROOT PASSOWRD RECOVERY

1. Power up / reboot
The first step is to power up or reboot the system and edit the grub2 parameters. Timing here is critical. 
You must press ‘e’ before the menu times out and boots normally.

2.....Look for a line that mentions linux16 (or linuxefi if you are using UEFI bios). You may need to use the arrow keys to scroll down. 
 At the end of the linux16 or linuxefi line, find and replace the rhgb quiet parameters with rd.break enforcing=0
 
 
3.......Once you have edited the parameters accordingly, hit CTRL-X to start the boot process with the new parameters.
 The system should boot into the root system
 
4......Enter the following command to remount the sysroot filesystem as read/write: mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

5.......Now we chroot into the sysroot, using the following command: chroot /sysroot

6. Change the password
We can use the passwd command to change the root password.

7. Return to switch_root
Issue the following command to bring us back to the switch_root:/# prompt: exit

8. Remount to read-only
Enter the following command to remount the sysroot filesystem as read-only once again: mount -o remount,ro /sysroot

9. Exit the session
Now we can exit the session and allow the system to reboot using the following command: exit

10. Boot and login
Allow the system to boot normally and login as root using the new password that you set in step 6.


11. Clean up
We must clean things up a bit before rebooting again or doing anything else with the system. 
First, let’s update the /etc/shadow file by issuing the following command: restorecon /etc/shadow

12. Set SELINUX
Finally we set our SELINUX back to enforcing mode by issuing the following command: setenforce 1





Method-1: Reset forgotten root password by booting into single user mode
This is easy and native method to reset the forgotten root password in RHEL 6/CentOS 6 systems. 
Just follow our instruction to do the password reset without any headache.

Step-1: Reboot your system and interrupt in boot screen by using any key from your keyboard to launch the GRUB Menu.
Step-2: In GRUB Menu, hit a key to modify the kernel arguments.
Step-3: Append S or single or 1 after a space at the end of the line and press Enter key to boot into single user mode.
Step-4: Once you hit Enter key then it will take to you into single user mode. Just type passwd command to reset the root user password. 
        Finally reboot the system by issuing init 6 or shutdown -r now command.

PATCHING

types of patching
 os patching==============given from OS side any updated service  ( for ex windows unix)
 application patching=====given from application provider (web sphere portal weblogic   enhanchement)
 network patching=========given for security(routers switches firewall devices security)
 
we cant do patching for n numbers of servers using in our environment
we have patching tools
   ibm big fix
   rcp tool
   ansible
   puppet
   chef 

steps:::::: pre check
 
su to root 
uptime
hostname
uname -a
cat /etc/grub/grub.conf
lsblk
blkid
vgdisplay
lvdisplay
fdisk -l
multipath -ll
check what type of application running on the system, we need to bring down the application at the time of patching, it will take reboot
cat /etc/redhat-relese
uname -r
rpm -q kernel --last
subscription-manager status
subscription-manager list
yum repolist
yum list available
yum updateinfo summary
check app/db team does it require to exclude any pakg since app/db may not compatibility with updated kernel
check ILO/console should be fine, it is becos if the server after patching goes down we can check with ILO


BASIC HEALTH CHECK::::::::::::;;

ifconfig
netstat -nr
df -TPH
cat /etc/fstab

IMPLEMENTATION

yum clean all
yum check-update
reboot
