bios ==== basic input and output system    old one
uefi === unififed extensible firmware interface   new one 

BIOS    It acts as a bridge between a computer’s hardware components and the operating system.


UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It does the same job as a BIOS, but with one basic difference: it stores all data about initialization and startup in an . ... UEFI supports drive sizes upto 9 zettabytes, whereas BIOS only supports 2.2 terabytes. UEFI provides faster boot time.

UEFI stores information about initialization and startup in an .efi file in a hard dive partition called EFI System Partition (ESP). It’s the same partition that contains the bootloader. What’s important to note here is that UEFI can directly boot the operating system bypassing the BIOS POST, which results in faster boot times.

What is the Difference Between BIOS and UEFI?
BIOS is legacy technology that goes back to the DOS era and is written in assembler, whereas the more modern UEFI is written in C. BIOS still works in 16-bit mode, which means it can only address 1MB of executable memory. This limits its ability to initialize multiple devices at once and leads to slower boot times.

On the other hand, UEFI can run in 64-bit mode, which means it has more addressable space than BIOS, making the boot process faster. The new technology also has a number of other advantages, including the ability to boot from much larger drives, with a theoretical limit of 9.4 Zettabytes (1ZB = 1000 exabytes = 1021 bytes). BIOS, on the other hand, can only boot from drives 2.2TB or smaller.


GRUB and GRUB2===============grub is the old one and grub2 is the new one


 Grub has two configuration files namely menu.lst and grub.conf whereas, Grub2 has only one main configuration file namely grub.cfg
 grub is difficult to modify    grub2 /etc/default/grub customizabel and human readable can be modified easyly once we made chnage give sudo update-grub
 
 grub boot menu display on booting     grub2 can hide boot menu
 
 
 booting method
 
 pxe,usb,cd,ipxe,iso,hard drive
 ipxe is more advanced then pxe
 
 While standardized PXE clients use TFTP to transfer data, non-standardized iPXE client firmware adds the ability to retrieve data through other protocols, including HTTP, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). ... iPXE is the official replacement for gPXE.
 
 if kernal panic error occur reboot the server and long press shift.
 it will take, to grub menu in that press advance option lastthe last successfully booted kernel.
 next remove the error kernal and reinstall the new kernal.
 
 present in /boot
 
 
 HOW TO LOAD modules automatically and how not to load error module during booting
 
 modprobe - Add and remove modules from the Linux Kernel
