AWS=== amazon web service provided by amazon
a cloud computing platform
uses distributed infrastructure   ( distrubuted infrastructure means hardware component will be in different area and all connected together by network)
large number of backend servers work together to provide aws server using network.

aws provide various IT resource such as 
	iaas   infrastructure as a service  ( provide service related to hardware)
	paas   platform as a service ( provide service related to software development tools)
	saas   software as a service (a particular full fledge software provided used by a company)
	
	CLOUD MEANS NETWORK OR INTERNET
	COMPUTING: USES REMOTE SERVER FOR STORING ALL THE FILES INSTEAD OF LOCAL DEVICE
	
	 why going to cloud computing
	 
	 cost maintaines
	 need database server mail servers switces networking for IT infrastructure   cloud computing will reduce all this
	 no need of maintaines engineer
	 
	 characterstics of cloud
	    agility  ( surusurupu active)
		availability and reliabality 
		multiple sharing
		maintaines cost is low
		pay for usage
		on demand service (when we need we get server as service)
		
TYPES OF CLOUD 
   PUBLIC CLOUD  PRIVATE CLOUD   HYBRID CLOUD  	COMMUNITY CLOUD

public cloud:
   it is open to all the users. user can access the cloud and pay for their usage.
   amazon maintance all the process, it is fliexiable. low cost, low security level.
   
private cloud:   
   internal or corporate cloud.
   have high security
   have access only to the corporate who own the cloud setup.
   high speed and high perforamce becos of less useage of cloud
   have limited access
   only access to the particular area
   
hybrid cloud:   
   combination of private and public cloud.
   critical and most important jobs are done using private cloud and non critical jobs are done by public cloud
   it is fliexible due to public cloud and more secured due to private cloud
   
communnity cloud   
   organization have cloud and share with the members of the community
   services can be access only by the particular community
   cloud is owned and managed by one of the organization of the community or  by the third party 
   cost is more then private cloud  hight security level
   
 CLOUD SERVICE MODELS
       IAAS PAAS SAAS

IAAS infrastruce as a service
  infrastruce as service like hardware
  reduce cost of buying phyiscal servers 
  managed by the service provider and not by us 
  no data loss 
  can be accessed by GUI and API (software) 

PAAS  platform as a service [========    development tool
   the platform needed for the programmer  to develop run test their own application can be accessed
   if we own PAAS, IAAS will come with this.
   for software developer, they just need to implemet there code on the server remainaig all will be provided by the service
   support multiple 	languages and frame work
   developed easy for software developer to use, 
   in aws it is provided as aws elastic beanstalk
   
SAAS  software as a service
   comes with licensed software on subscribiton basics
   web software and apps needed to performe are provided on pay usage
   user no need to worry about app update
   
   
   
                        AWS AMAZON web service is a cloud platform

services offered by aws 
    all servies are used, pay per usage
         computing            ===================basic hardware requirement
         networking           ================== network switch routres
         database             =================== data storeage can be used to store day, no data loss will happen and data backup will bbe provided
         programming models    ===============bigdata processing models can be given using this models(just for example we can have more models)
         develpment platform	=============for software develpment, all the tools will be provided, multi language 


2006 it is offical launcehed AWS



GLOBAL infrastruce

   		 region--------availability zone ----------- it is a data center setup , have firewall, storage,, backup, all service will be in this zone
		 
		 

IAM

components of IAM
   users groups roles policies 
   
   users ==using iam once we created the user need to give admin access and going further need to login as the user account we created(having admin access.
   once we created user account(while creating user account in IAM in the second page go down we see admin groups,click that) we get url on top after created the user, using that url only we need to login.
   user account with admin permission is different, and root account is different. 
   
   
   
   groups::::: we need to create group and we need to select the permission for the group :::ex  only to access s3 or creating ec2 instance./
   later creating new user, while creating we have option to join user to the group. if we have user to the group that user will have only s3 or ec2 access, apart from that if he try to access any thing he get warning message 
   
   ROLES:::
     similar to user but assigned to applciation.
	 we have ec2 instance web application and it need to intreact with s3 
	 creat role in IAM and click roles and attach this roles to that particukar ec2 instance.
	 create role in IAM click create new role we have more roles, for ex select ec2 instance and select policy we select s3 access
	 then go to instance click action on the instance,  click instance setting select add/replace roles in iAM role we have created role and select.
	 
	 
	 POLICIES:::
	  to assign permission to a user or group role or resource we create policy,created using iam roles policy
	  we can create roles like allow or deny for particlar user or groups and assign this policy to the users or groups.
	  once policy applied user or groups memebrs acnt access the resource as per our policy created.
	  
	  
	  giving multifactor authentication.
	  
	  click users, in users security credential in down we can see asssigned mfa no 

identity and access managemant
    it wont give all permission to all user to all the servers    
	limited permission to limited user on limited services
	for exam admin access given only to admin group users   high secured
	identity fedreation=======   
	multifactor authentication==============
	payment card security
	free to use====== no need to pay separately for this 
	once we left the organisation we cant access the service, which is controlled by IAM
	
	
SAML	
  security assertion markup language
  authentication provided by identity provider.
  single sign on 
  
  messages passed from identity provided to service provider
   who logged in when logged in on which methode user logged in 
   attribute, who looged in and from which department logged in 
   authorization decision:  who can access the service, permission of the users 
   
   
   user--------service provider---------identity provider
   
   once user try to access the service, service provider request single sign on to identity provider
   identity provider check user identification and respond with xhtml document of user info.
   and send to service provider 
   
IAM IDENTITIES

uses of IAM 

iam root users 
   basic users are called iam root users. managing all the accounts, unrestricted access can access all the resource,biling is done by this user
iam user
   normal user, permission need to be given(limited permission) 
iam group
   collection og users,
   adding user to the groups and the permission will be same which is given to the group.
   easy to manage permision of the user
   
   
ROLES of IAM::::::
 iam roles 
      set of permission to grant acccess and action to the resources that is assosiated with the roles.
      for exam to off or on particlar resource or service the access is not given to user, it is given to roles and user who all playing the roles will have access
      temporary security credentials	  
  
who can access this roles
    iam user ( normal user)
    application and service
    federated users (outside users)  can allot a particulae time on that time outside user can access
way to use roles::::
    IAM console,   
        for example normal user (iam user) will have set a default limitted permission, when they requested to play roles, they default permission will get removed and only roles access given. once there roles work done they will released from the roles and default permissin will be given back.

   STORGAE

amazon s3
 simple storage device or service so it is called s3
 object based storage 
 bucket of unlimited size first we need to create bucket then files are stored in it. people who creat the bucket is th eowner.he cant transfer his ownlership
 maximun size 5 tp bucket
 it is cloud so we can access from any where
 we can give upload and download permission .
 untill we give permission no one can view this
 in the bucket have dns name 
 
 S3
   region we can chose geographical, to have fast access.
   data consistency:
      

object contain:
 keys
 value
 access permission
 metadata
 version
 subresource

  https://image.s3.amazon.com/pic23.jpg
 here image is the bucket name and pic23 is the keys


s3 storage classes

s3 standars::::::::::::::::::::
    while we stored data in this class, it will store in three  places.so no data loss will happene
	no delay time and efficiency. can use fastly.. if we did int mention any storgae class by default it will be s3 standarad
	
s3 standard infrequent access;;;;;;;;;;
   data which is not used frequently can be stored in this class
   data should be min 128 kb
   fast access of data
   mininum amount is charged 
   no data loss
 
 
 s3 zone infrequent access:::;;;;;;;;;;;;;
     data which is not used frequently can be stored in this class
	 single availabilty storgae, so will have data loss
	 data should be min 128 kb
	 minimun amount is charged
	 
s3 glacier:::::::::::::::::::;
     cheapest storgae 
     data can be stored which is not used for so long
     retrival time is more
     no data loss
	 minimum amount is charged
     	 
==================================================================================================

amazon EC2   elastic compute cloud 


   provide computing hardware devide to run a program 
   to runa program we need cpu memory ram storage, all this are provided by ec2 
   provide virtual server insttanlly 
   going to pay whenwe use and we can release the service when it is not used and we r not going to pay for it
   
   instance machine wat we require:
      cpu,memory,networking,capacity.
   AMI   ( software configration, os, application)    =====while getting instance(server) first we chose os linux or windows
   storage volume======= to store data we need storage
   tags=========if we have multiple instance(server) calling all the server separately is hard. to call all the server(instance) at once we use tags
   vpc =========virtual private cloud  
   from AMI we lanuch the instance===========ami will be present in the root device.
   stop and terminate instance 
      

using AMI only we can call our instance(server).
first we request on AMI


PRICING OPTION OF EC2::::::::::

    on demand  
	   pay per hour or second
	   low cost and fliexible
	   requirement not known=( when we are not sure on how much time we use the instance then we can go with pay per hour)
	   
	   
	reserverd
      contract with amazon===( booking instance for 3 years(for example)
       predictable usage==========we know how long we use the instance 
          3 types   standard reserverd instance 75% discount
                    convertible reserverd instace 54 % discount( if we r not using the instance we can conver or exchange with differebt instance )
                    scheduled reserverd ======for short term usage we use this
    
    spot instance:
        bid for a price ===== yelathuku yedukurathu pola 

    dedicated instance:
        phsyical server with ec2 instance capacity ( in this we can use our own software licience)
        70% discount on reservation


================================================================================================================


AMI    amazon machine language   

   software configuration 
    types:
      instance store  
          temporary storage  =========once we stop the instance data will get lost
          boot time less then 5 min
		  no stop operation=====so we need to termiante untill we terminate we need to pay 
		  data loss during failure
		  
	  EBS BACKED instance ( elastic block store)
          no data loss 
          permanenet storgae==== data will be available even if we delete the instance but we need to pay for it
          boot time  is less then 1 min 
          stop option permitted 
          can recover from failure
          we can chnage instance based at any time, like chnaging kernel, storgae volume, but instance need to be stopped that time
          will be charged only for run time and not for stopped hours	
     EBS volume types  
        ssd backed volumes=======depends on I/O we chose the volume, used for hign i/o operation 
		     general purpose ssd
			 provisioned ssd
        hhd backed volumes 	
            cold hdd
            magentic volume

LAMBDA
   
   
   till now for to run our code or program  we need instance, and we should know wat cpu network storage application required to run the code
   to over come this issue we use LAMBDA, once we upload the code in amazon, LAMBDA will do every thing. it will allot cpu network storage application.
   even if more cpu storage required it will automaticallly allot.
   
   no need to worry about IAAS PAAS
   
   used in 2 ways
       http request using amazon api calls
	   event driven compute service
		  
		  
		  click lambda----click create function---give lamdba function name-----selet code below the function name given ---------seletct permission
		  (we have chose or create)-----then click create function------we get notification in the next page (fucntion code create successfully)---
		  add trigger---select trigger configuration----in the lamda fucntion tab we can see our created code 
 		  
 how to launch and create instance 

      click EC2--------click launch instance( in the page below------we will redirect to ami page(where all instanc are located---left side we can see free tire(free instance) will get all free machine--- based on your requirement selet the machine-----next page choose an instance type----
	  we can see sysment cpus network memory storgae, based on our reqirement we can select--configure instance details(number of instance we need,
	  purchasing option( if we quote the price we can get discount) network can create new vpc, i am role can be nominated,shutdown behaviour, procet againt accidental termination---  next storgae , root type where located and volume type depens on I/O of the system---next tags  to mention tags for the instance and deparatment code---- nextconfigure security group ,selet group and type of network to reach instance----
	  review and lanuch we see all our selection from the begining, if we need any changes we can chnage.,,,, selet magnetci if for our own use, but based on project requierment we need to selet, already we seleted this but to conform it will ask.---- once we launch selet create a new key pai and give name as of our won and download the key pair then click launch instance, go down to the page and click view instance---
	  now our instance will be created.
	  
	  
	  how to use the launced INSTANCE
	  
	       to terminate our instance first go to ---action--instance setting--chnage termination policy--- disbale it if it in is enable state we cant terminate our instance---
		   
		   download putty and putty gen, in download we can see putty and putty gen
		   in the begining while installaing instance we genetare public key and it get stored in our system with the name extention .pem(as it is mandatory to use our instance)
		   putty is used to connect instance and putty gen used to convert .pem file into .ppk file, direcily we cant use the .pem file to conncet so to convert this we need putty gen.
		   open putty gen  click load it will take other pages of our windwos drive in the bottom chnage putty private key .ppk to all files. chose the key which we created for instance and click  and and chnage from putty private keys to all file in the dialouge box.
		   selet .pem file and click save private key it will gnetare a key save with the name extension as eckey.ppk (eckey just i gave)
		   
		   go to the instance and in the instance down page we can see public IP ipv4 copu ec2-user@34.224.41.244 and open putty save the ec2-user@3.90.84.47  and open ssh in the putty option and clieck auth and click browse select .ppk file which we stored noneed to open, go to session and give ec2-user@34.224.41.244 and click save and click open 
		   use ec2-user for the first logginonce logged in using sudo su - to root and set root password.
		   
		   got server server refused our key putty aws ec2 while installing the machine
		   used to connect using hostname ec2-38-239-22-12.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com(Public IPv4 DNS) with a saved section in putty

		   go to iam click groups and click create new group=== group name 
		   
		   
		   roles::::
		   
		      click roles--click create roles---Select type of trusted entity   we have aws service,another aws user,web identity,saml  then selet Choose a use case, no we selet ec2 --------Attach permissions policies, to which we need to give access we need to selet, we have more policy, -----next tags  IAM tags are key-value pairs you can add to your role. Tags can include user information, such as an email address, or can be descriptive, such as a job title. You can use the tags to organize, track, or control access for this role-----Review give role name

			 select storage s3 ====we get page to create bucket(means folder) click create bucket-----Bucket name(should be unique),select AWS Region===== select correct regio for easy access of the creating bucket, our region asia pacific mumbai, come down Bucket Versioning===
			 if we enable versiooning our previous file will be present, if we uplod new same file, we get two files(old and new one)
			 if we forget to give public or private version, after creating the bucket we can chnage using permission option.
		   
		   
		   Amazon S3==============we use this life cycle option to move not frequently used data to cheapest data, becos to cost minimize. storage provided by aws is costly depend on teh requirment
